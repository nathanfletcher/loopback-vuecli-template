- At the root of the project, run `npm install`
- cd into the `client` directory and also run `npm install`
the client directory is a VueJs-Webpack template (still in progress, but runs)

In order to run
Run `node .` in the root directory to start the API server
- It would try to add seed data of Users and Notes into the memory database
- The API server runs on PORT 3001 and 
-- You can access the client on http://localhost:3001
-- You can access the api endpoint interface on http://localhost:3001/explorer/


Remember to watch videos on Lynda.com on Vue CLI and Loopback to get up to speed on this template.
